      size=3><STRONG>INTERVIEW with Melissa Lea Leedom</STRONG></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>1. What do you 
      hope to accomplish through your writing?</STRONG><BR><BR>Jesus said that 
      we are to be "salt and light" to the world around us. I want the 
      characters in my stories to embody those Christian characteristics. I want 
      to show real, everyday people striving to live as Christ would have them 
      live, and have them interact in stories where their relationship with 
      Christ affects their relationships with each other. When I decided to 
      write my first novel, I knew I wanted to write a love story, but I decided 
      there were enough writers out there writing the amoral stuff. I thought it 
      was time somebody wrote stories about Christian singles and showed that it 
      is possible to operate within the Christian set of values in a modern 
      setting. I hadn't seen very much of that in novels when I started 
      writing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>2. Are any of 
      your characters based on real people?</STRONG><BR><BR>Yes, a few. I 
      actually did know a woman in her early thirties who had been widowed with 
      two young children, and I often wondered what it would be like to be in 
      her position, how long it might take before I would be ready to see 
      someone new. That provided the germ of a story idea for To Forgive, 
      Divine. Also, when we lived in Alabama, I was on a local board of 
      directors of a Habitat for Humanity chapter. That was the idea behind the 
      Chandler City Benevolent Council. I have been blessed to have known 
      several wonderful pastors. Jeff Wells is a composite and a tribute to 
      these wonderful men. There is a little bit of my grandmother in Ruth 
      Newton, a little bit of my own best friend in Cheryl, and a little bit of 
      me in several of the characters!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>3. How do you 
      create a story?</STRONG><BR><BR>The characters come first. I think of 
      people I'd like personally, who'd be in a situation to which I'd be 
      sympathetic, like Bonnie Callaway's. Then I start playing "What if?" "What 
      if such-and-such a person entered her life?" "What roadblocks could be 
      thrown in the way?" "What situations would bring this couple back into 
      each other's company?" The complicating situations are what created the 
      subplots and what helped to enrich the story in To Forgive, Divine. But it 
      also served the purpose of showing Bonnie and Jeff at work in their 
      Christian lives. In Book II (no title yet), we'll see Carolyn Perkins and 
      Jenny Pierce in their own stories.<BR></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>4. At what age 
      did you decide you wanted to be a writer?</STRONG></STRONG><BR><BR>I've always 
      liked to write, since about the fourth or fifth grade. But I don't think I 
      was really aware that a writer was something you could "be" like a teacher 
      or a nurse or a pilot, until I was well into my 20s. I guess I never 
      really gave much thought about where books came from. It wasn't until I 
      was browsing in a bookstore when I lived in Washington and stumbled onto 
      Writer's Digest that I got the idea that you could do something with the 
      stories you scribbled down (I used to like to write long-hand!), and that 
      perhaps you could even make a living at it! (I've heard that some 
      do...)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>5. What advice 
      would you offer to a beginning author?</STRONG><BR><BR>Read as much as you 
      can of the genre you'd like write. Try to internalize the patterns in the 
      plotting--see how things fit and flow together, see how the author uses 
      foreshadowing.<BR><BR>Assess your skill level. If you weren't good at 
      spelling and grammar in school, enroll in a community college course and 
      brush up your skills. Invest in a couple of good reference books to have 
      handy as you write.<BR><BR>Write. Write as much as you can. Don't edit as 
      you go. Get your story out of you on paper. Let your characters live their 
      lives, be who they are. Write your story or your book, then set it aside 
      for a month. Then go back and begin re-writing. If you have the benefit of 
      a critique group of one or two other knowledgeable people, take advantage 
      of it. But follow your instincts about your characters.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>6. Who do you 
      think are your greatest influences?</STRONG><BR><BR>Without a doubt, the 
      Sunday School teachers, youth ministers, and pastors I had as a teenager 
      were my greatest influences. I am grateful to have been the recipient of 
      so much love and dedication. As the song says, "I am a life that was 
      changed; I am so glad you gave."</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>7. What do you 
      think it means to be a Christian writer?</STRONG><BR><BR>I can only say 
      what it means to me, or what I think it should mean. C.S. Lewis said, 
      "Everything I write is evangelistic." That should be the goal of every 
      Christian writer, that somehow, through his or her work, the saving 
      message of Christ would shine through and that readers would know that 
      Jesus Christ is Lord.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>8. What is the 
      single greatest mistake you think authors make 
      today?</STRONG><BR><BR>Christian authors or secular authors, or both? If I 
      had to narrow it down to Christian authors, I have to say I see a tendency 
      in many books to "secularize." Stories are "clean," in that there is no 
      overt immorality, but there is little or no mention of Christ, so that 
      "inspirational" stories are more palatable to a mass audience. I think 
      that is a mistake. We cannot be salt if we have lost our savor.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><STRONG>10. What do 
      you think is the most rewarding part of your work?</STRONG><BR><BR>I 
      always enjoy speaking to groups and seeing the response of Christian 
      singles to a book about "them." I think (and apparently so do many of 
      them) that they are the most underrepresented group in Christian fiction.
