	<h1>Why Read The Bible?</h1>
	<img style="float: right;" src="img/image1.jpg" />
	<p>A follower of Jesus is a person who:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
	<li>has accepted Jesus as Savior
	<li>has decided to live life by following Jesus' teachings and His plan for our lives.
	</ul>
	
	<p>Followers of Jesus believe that the Holy Bible is God's message to mankind. </p>
	<p>They know that, if they are truly to know God in the personal way He intended for us, they need to read the Bible. To be real followers of Jesus, that is, people who have determined to live according to the way He taught when He was here on earth, we need to read the Bible. We need to know WHY we believe Jesus was the Son of God, and about the events that led to God sending Him to earth to be our Savior.</p>
	
	<p>If you did not grow up reading the Bible and don't know much (if anything) about it, you are not alone! This little book is intended to help you understand what kind of book the Bible is:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>how it was written
	<li>how to find a story or passage in the Bible
	<li>the main story the Bible tells
	</ul>
	<p>God will bless your spirit and draw you closer as you come to know Him through reading the Bible!</p>
