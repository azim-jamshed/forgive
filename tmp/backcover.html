<b><i>Bonnie Callaway</i></b> Since the accident that killed her husband two years ago, Bonnie's had no room in her heart for new love. She certainly didn't plan to fall for her also-widowed pastor! </p>
<p>
<b><i>Jeff Wells</i></b> can't wait to see Bonnie again. But nosy neighbor Clara Adkinson informs him that he isn't the only man in Bonnie's life! Who is this other guy?</p>
<p>
As their story unfolds in To Forgive, Divine, close friends (and closer enemies!) realize that things aren't always as they appear. Even when they discover the truth, feelings of betrayal and distrust seem to destroy any hope of rekindling the love Bonnie and Jeff had started to feel for each other.</p>
<p>
Enter a young boy who desperately needs help that only Bonnie and Jeff can give him,
an embittered young woman who learns about forgiveness from these two people who can't seem to forgive each other, and an estranged couple who need just a little push from reluctant lovers Bonnie and Jeff to re-write their own ill-fated love story. Bonnie and Jeff can't avoid seeing each other even when they try!</p>
<p>
As Bonnie and Jeff watch lives transformed all around them by the love and forgiveness of Jesus, they must confront their own failure to forgive. How can they recommend Christian love to everyone else and deny it to each other?</p>
