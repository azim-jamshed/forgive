<h1>Send Warmth to Romania</h1>

<p>In March of 2005,<a href="http://www.peoplesharingjesus.com/romanian.php">Crestview Baptist Church</a> responded to an invitation from Dr. Paul Negrut of Emanuel University (http://www.emanuel.ro/) by sending a team of 38 members to Oradea, Romania. The purpose of the trip was three-fold: 
* Provide a music and evangelism program of encouragement to the university and regional Baptist churches. 
* Have fellowship with the young ministers, teachers and businessmen and women in training at the university. 
* Assess and begin planning for future mission and ministry opportunities.

While in the country, the team provided music and preaching at several churches. They took part in street evangelism, visited orphanages and took part in many social service activities provided by the school. Over the course of the trip there were several professions of faith made during ministry activities. Some members met with students, provided teaching and lectures and met with local business leaders. Over 200 Romanian bibles were provided by the group and, later, a scholarship donation of over $1000 was given to the seminary. 
</p> 
<p>The Piecemakers, a needlework group that meets at Crestview Baptist Church, will be knitting and crocheting baby blankets and children's sweaterse to send with the 2007 Romania team.</p> 
<p>If you would like to contribute to this effort, we would welcome NEW hand-made baby blankets crafted from soft cotton or cotton/silk blend yarn, and children's sweaters of soft wool, alpaca or a blend of these with either cotton or silk. Here are links to very simple baby blanket patterns:</p>

<p>Contributions of yarn for this project would also be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Please send your completed blankets and sweaters to:<p><p>Blankets for Romania<p>c/o Melissa Leedom<p>P.O. Box 1884<p>Georgetown, TX 78627<p><p>Blankets must be received no later than May 4, 2007. Thank you so  much for your help.</p>

<p>It isn't even May, and already the blankets have been piling up like crazy! We are closing in on 30 so far! I've received blankets from as far away as Alabama! There have been over 150 hits to this page. Just think: if everyone who clicked on this site sent in a blanket, what a wonderful outpouring of love  it would be for the children of the orphanage! Again, I thank you for your help!</p></td>
