Melissa Leedom has jumped right to the top along with the multiple-book authors with this her first Christian romance novel. I didn't want to put it down! I hung on each chapter eagerly anticipating what would happen next.  Her character development was all too real in church life.  I can hardly wait for the next book!</p>

<i>To Forgive, Divine </i>is a fun read. Melissa really knows the dynamics of a congregation. I highly recommend it!

Melissa's characters face real struggles to live out their Christianity and keep their faith intact. I read til 4 A.M. because I had to see how it ended. This book is wonderful!

I have just finished your book, and pray that it gets a wide reading. It is well done, and I appreciate the message on forgiveness plus the wonderful tale. My guess would be, if I did not know it for a fact, that you have been involved in Baptist church life. I will encourage all three of my daughters to read it - wishing that my oldest could have read it, too. I like Jeff Wells, and appreciate your naming him for me.</p>

<p class="quote">I have read your book and it was a blessing. I wanted you to know that I have recommended to all the Texas Baptist Camp managers that they carry <i>To Forgive, Divine</i> in their gift/bookstores.</p>
