<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>After
tucking her boys in, Bonnie headed toward the kitchen to make herself a cup of
tea to sip in the tub. As she turned to the pantry, she heard a soft tapping at
the kitchen door and froze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
turned toward the door slowly, half dreading what she might see, yet hoping
against hope that somehow Jeff might have reconsidered his decision and come to
see her again. Nothing could have prepared her, however, for seeing Anna Lee
Adkinson looking at her through her kitchen door window. After a moment�s
hesitation, Bonnie walked over and unlocked the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Guess
I�m probably about the last person <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>
ever expected to see at your door,� Anna Lee said with an ironic smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
ignored the comment, but remarked to herself that perhaps Anna Lee was not so
shy after all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Please,
come in. I�m just about to have some tea. Would you care for some?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Sure,
that sounds great.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Anna
Lee sat down at the kitchen table and waited for Bonnie to finish preparing
their tea. Dress for church on Sunday evenings was always casual, but the
sweatshirt Anna Lee wore over her jeans did little for her figure. Bonnie
recognized her running shoes as one of the more expensive brands, but they
weren�t very new or clean. Anna Lee just didn�t seem to care much about her
appearance. Her glossy auburn hair, which was beautiful despite its relatively
neglected state, hung to just below her waist; she alternately wrapped and
unwrapped a long strand around her forefinger as she slouched in her chair.
Bonnie set two steaming mugs of tea on the table, sat opposite Anna Lee, and
waited to find out what had brought Clara�s daughter to see her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Holding
her mug with both hands, breathing in the fragrant aroma of chamomile, Anna Lee
looked thoughtful for a moment and then began:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�I
didn�t get a chance to talk to you at Jenny�s tonight, but I did want to talk
to you. Guess you�re wondering why.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
acknowledged this truth with a nod. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�I
know you realize that I have no control over what my mother does.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
sighed and looked into her teacup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�I
just wanted you to know how very sorry I am that you had to get caught in the
middle of all of this.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
looked up, her eyes searching Anna Lee�s face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�All
of what? What�s going on?� </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;tab-stops:-.5in'>* * *</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�But
isn�t there anything you can say to her that would convince her to give up her
crusade to marry you off to Dr. Wells?� Bonnie asked. �Have you tried telling
her that you�re not interested in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>him</i>?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>At
this, Anna Lee�s face clouded. She said nothing at first, but just looked intently
into her mug. She took another sip of tea, as if buying herself time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Then,
almost in a whisper, she said, �I almost got married once. A long time ago.
Someone I met in college.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
watched Anna Lee, fascinated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�I
brought him home to meet Mom over spring break in our senior year. He was going
to enter the seminary in the fall. He wanted to be a minister of music.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Anna
Lee set her mug on the table and looked at Bonnie, fire in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Well,
Mom had a fit. She said there was no way she was going to let her daughter
throw herself away on some preacher so she could be poor as a church mouse. No
pun intended, I�m sure.� She smiled a sardonic little smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Your
mom�s kind of fixated on money, huh? Did your dad not leave you guys much when
he died?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
really didn�t think this could be the case, given the model of car Clara drove
and the size of the house they lived in across the street from Jeff Wells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Died?�
Anna Lee looked at Bonnie incredulously. �My dad isn�t dead! He lives in
Jacksonville, Florida. Where�d you get the idea that he was dead?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�I...I
don�t know,� Bonnie stammered. �I guess I�I just <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assumed</i> that your mother was a widow. Like her friend, Mertis.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>It
struck Bonnie that she, too, had been guilty of drawing hasty conclusions. Now
that she thought about it, she realized that she couldn�t recall ever speaking
with anyone on the subject. She had simply assumed Clara was a widow because
most of the women in the Senior Adult group <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i>
widows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Oh,
no, Mom and Dad have been divorced since I was about nine or ten. He was a
sales rep for a textbook publisher before he retired. One Monday morning he
left to visit campuses in northern Florida. He called to check in every night
that week, just as he always had, and then on Friday evening, he called to say
that he wasn�t coming back. Mom was furious, of course, but I have to say, it
was hard to blame him. Even as young as I was, I could see she led him a dog�s
life. He married a woman he met in Jacksonville about two years after the divorce
was final. Her name is Shirley�she was one of the math professors he sold
textbooks to. They�ve been happily married going on fourteen years. I don�t get
to see him as much as I�d like to, but I�m happy for him.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Anna
Lee drank the last of her tea and set her empty cup on the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�The
problem was, Mom was the one who had money. I don�t know all of the details, of
course, but she apparently had to settle quite a large sum on him when they
split up. She�s very bitter and doesn�t believe that he ever loved her. She
thinks he was always after her money, which is kind of irrational�they were
married over twenty years. They were married twelve years before she finally
had me.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Then,
after a thoughtful pause, she continued, �Still, if people thought she was a
widow, I can see where she wouldn�t go out of her way to set them straight.
She�s never forgiven Dad for making her a divorcee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Well,
anyway, as soon as I was old enough to date, she tried to instill in me the
importance of finding a man whose family had money so he wouldn�t be after
mine.� Anna Lee rolled her eyes at the memory. �It was such a relief to go away
to college and not have to have her pass judgment on every guy who asked me
out. Because, believe me, there weren�t that many to begin with.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>She
paused and bit her lip pensively, then continued softly: �Then, I met this guy,
and we fell in love. It wasn�t love at first sight or anything like that. We
were good friends at first. For a couple of years, actually. We met at the
Baptist Student Union on campus. We both played guitar and sang, although he
was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much</i> better than I was. We began
to sing duets together at BSU events and local churches and for weddings. We
just got along great�and we were really in demand. We were pulling in some
pretty good money for a couple of college students. Then, one night...�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Anna
Lee�s face was transformed. She was in a place and time long left behind, but
obviously not forgotten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�One
Friday night, he�d driven me back to my dorm after we�d sung together at a wedding.
I turned to say goodnight, as usual, and it was like BOOM! We looked at each
other like it was the first time we�d ever seen each other. He kissed me, and
we both wondered how we�d missed each other before.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>There
was amazement in her eyes at her memory of the moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Oh,
Bonnie, if you could�ve known him. He was so wonderful. Such a strong
Christian. And he was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gorgeous</i>. All
the girls in the BSU were half crazy over him. Why he liked someone like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>, I�ll never know. But after that
kiss, there was some serious chemistry between us!� Her eyes were far away,
remembering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Don�t
sell yourself short,� Bonnie murmured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Well,
looks didn�t cut any mustard with my mother. Nor did the fact that he was a sweet,
wonderful, Christian man. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Her</i>
daughter wasn�t going to marry a poor seminary student wanting to be a poor
preacher, and that was that.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Kind
of ironic that now she�s moving heaven and earth to get you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to</i> marry a preacher, isn�t it?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Anna
Lee laughed derisively. �Yeah, only this preacher�s got bucks.� She paused,
playing with a strand of her long, auburn hair. �And I guess�Oh, I don�t know!
My mother has always been so intimidating!�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
could vouch for that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�She
had me doubting my own judgment. She said that college romances wouldn�t last
because we lived in a make-believe world, that I wouldn�t know what real love
was until I�d lived in the real world, whatever <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>that</i> means.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Tears
streamed down Anna Lee�s cheeks now. The words tumbled out of her, as if she
had wanted to tell this story to someone for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�She
asked me how I could be so sure about being in love when I�d never dated anyone
else seriously before. She kept reminding me about my dad leaving her and
getting all that money from her. I mean, Mark didn�t even <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>know</i> our family has money. I knew he liked me just for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>, but somehow, I let her talk me into
breaking off our engagement, anyway.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
was stricken for the young Miss Adkinson, defenseless against her mother�s
intimidation tactics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Mark
was his name?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Yeah,�
she whispered. She looked at Bonnie, gratitude in her eyes, as if it meant a
lot to her that Bonnie understood her side of the story. �So, if you ask me why
I haven�t told my mother that I�m not interested in Jeff Wells, I guess I�d
have to say, experience has taught me she hasn�t always been too concerned
about what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> preferences were.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Oh,
Anna Lee!�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Those
last two months of school were awful. I�m lucky I graduated. I was so
depressed, I could hardly study anymore. I had to quit going to the BSU so I wouldn�t
see him. People couldn�t understand why we weren�t available to sing together
anymore, but no one really knew that we�d been seeing each other, you know,
dating each other.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>She
plucked a paper napkin from the holder in the center of the table and wiped her
eyes and blew her nose. She began again with a sigh: �After we graduated, he
went home to Nashville and I came home to be a teacher.� Through her tears, she
smiled enigmatically. �I guess in a lot ways, I�ve never really gotten over
him. I�ve never felt even remotely the same about anyone since Mark.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Did
you ever hear from him again over the years?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Not
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i> him,� she answered slowly. �I
don�t think he ever was able to forgive me for breaking up with him. Can�t say
that I blame him. But I�ve certainly heard <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of</i>
him. Instead of going into church work, he got involved in a Christian singing
group that became very popular, and then he went out on his own. Joke�s on my
mom, I guess, �cause now he�s pulling down some seriously big money. He�s probably
worth several million by now.� She paused and looked at Bonnie. �Maybe you�ve
heard of him. His name is Mark Miller.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>Bonnie
was thunderstruck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�You
were engaged to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mark Miller</i>?� </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>He
was only one of the most popular contemporary Christian singers in the country.
In fact, he had a crossover hit, a re-make of the seventies rock anthem,
�Spirit in the Sky,� on the Top 40, Country, and Christian radio stations right
now. Bonnie knew that he even had a couple of Grammy awards to his credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Believe
it or not,� she answered, resignation in her voice. �Not that anyone knows
about it but Mark, my mother, and me. I doubt seriously that he told anyone
that a mousy little girl like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>
turned him down.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>It
pained Bonnie to hear Anna Lee talk that way about herself. Anna Lee looked at
Bonnie through tear-swollen eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>�Even
though your husband died,� Anna Lee began again slowly, �you were lucky to have
married the man you loved and known happiness with him. I hope you never have
to go through falling in love with someone you�ll never be together with. I
hope you never have the pain of feeling there�s someone you�ll never be over.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:-.5in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����������� </span>As
Bonnie thought once again about the kiss she and Jeff had shared Friday night
and felt again the sinking sensation in her stomach she�d had when Jeff had
told her he didn�t want to see her anymore, she fervently hoped so, too.</p>
