<p class="quote">This book is great! I just love that the story revolves around a church, reminding us that church members aren't perfect, just forgiven... as the saying goes... and I love the forgiveness theme. </p>
<p class="quote">


<p>In theory, forgiveness seems so easy...but in practicality, it never seems to be in my life!! It's like I can picture church members that I know for each character, with their personalities and situations. (Unfortunately, I've pictured a few "Claras" from different congregations I've been a part of, too! And, it stands as a huge reminder for ME not to ever be a Clara!)  </p>
<p class="quote">


<p>I couldn't wait to finish! The writing pulled me in from the very beginning! I was so invested in the characters!</p>

<p class="quote">Although it seems like another "boy meets girl" story, this novel is much more profound. It is preciously written. I found it hard not to devour the book in one sit, because the main couple is adorable and relatable. It was automatic to believe them and feel antipathy for their main enemy. The author's craft at describing their feelings, and how these inner thoughts blocked their chances to be together, is admirable. There are several twists and surprises. The Christian environment also adds to the singularity of this novel, as belonging to an evangelical church does not seem to help the couple much. But all this is appearances, as there is the love, faith, sadness, jealousy, and forgiveness that Christianity has shown us. This novel has it all. Totally recommended. </p>

<p class="quote">I thoroughly enjoyed reading this compelling book. Not only is the characterization tight, but the pace is fast and commands the reader's attention. Moreover, the message rings true throughout ~ fascinating people that grab your heart and work through problems that most people face in one way or another. This is probably the BEST Christian novel I've read in a very long time. Highly recommend!</p>

I read it most of the day yesterday...didn't want to put it down!</p>   <p>I finished it last night. Absolutely loved it!  The characters seemed so real and genuine.  And I think probably every church must have a Clara in the congregation! She made me so mad!</p>  <p>And Pastor Jeff (like so many men I know) was so clueless!</p> <p>Christian romance is one of my favorite genres.  I am so glad I discovered <i>To Forgive, Divine</i>!

<p class="quote">The author does a brilliant job of catching the attention of the reader by creating characters that are interesting and have great depth.

<p class="quote">Bonnie is a widow with two young sons living in a typical southern town. The author's depiction of friendships, neighbors, work relationships, and church family all help to build a very believable world that I enjoyed stepping into.</p>
<p>The attraction between Bonnie and Jeff, her widowed pastor did not feel rushed. The story is paced well, and the characters go through emotional turmoil that keeps the story interesting and made me want to read the next chapter. Their love grew as the story unfolded. I was sad when the story came to an end and would love to visit this town again.</p>
<p>Great job Melissa Lea Leedom!</p>

<p class="quote">What a fantastic contemporary Christian romance! </p>
<p class="quote">


<p>I loved how she brought each character to life. Many times as I was reading I felt like I was watching a movie because of her ability to bring you along in her descriptive way. </p>
<p class="quote">


<p>You'll find yourself cheering some of the characters on, at one point I had to laugh because her book almost begs you to forgive one of the ladies because she builds her personality so well you actually think you know her. </p>

<p class="quote">
There are many Christian books on the market today, so it's refreshing when one stands out in both plot and characters. Leedom has taken a basic principle of the Christian faith--forgiveness--and put a spin on it that involves the everyday challenges we all face, yet often neglect to overcome. There were times when the pace of the story was so intense, I couldn't put it down, and overall, the characters were realistic. The likeable ones were likeable and the others folks we've all encountered. Hopefully, Leedom will follow up with a couple of the characters and give us their stories in the future. Well worth your time to read.</p>

<p class="quote">More Than a Typical Love Story! Melissa Leedom's engaging writing style kept me riveted and desiring to know what happens next to the characters she so thoroughly described. If you like romances, you will find this story enjoyable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> goes beyond a typical love story plot with a profound message of forgiveness supported by Scripture. The importance of open and honest communication when we feel offended instead of acting on our assumptions, which may be incorrect, became apparent as the characters struggled with their emotions.</p>

<p class="quote">You look at a book and the title is different - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i> - A Novel</a>? You turn to glance at another book, but something pulls you back. I thought, "I seldom read novels." You turn away, and, again, the title intrigues you. </p>

<p>You start to read the story of two people in the South. The words pull you to read on to the next page.  Something in the way this story reflects real life keeps you turning pages.</p>

<p>Bonnie and Jeff have a casual friendship.. A church minister, a twinkle in the eye. No, it can’t be. Why?</p>

<p>A spying neighbor... I should turn the lights off and get some sleep. But no, I must see what comes next. </p>

<p>Then comes a walk on a beautiful moonlit beach. How does this finally happen?  You might be surprised where this book will take you.. I highly recommend it!</p><p class="citation">Rev. Bruce Manning<br>Missionary to Chile, Retired, Author<a href="https://amzn.to/3P7xJW6"><i>Fiel Faithful Pistos</i></a><br></p>

<p class="quote">In this story, Melissa Leedom demonstrates comfortable and credible prose, as well as a thorough understanding of human interaction. Her tale is set against the backdrop of life within the culture of a Christian church in the south, which will be familiar to adherents, but not off-putting to the uninitiated. At the same time, as the title suggests, the author intends a thorough consideration of the notion of forgiveness and reconciliation. With generous use of internal dialogue, primarily from the major female character, Ms. Leedom constructs several "good" characters, never hesitating to expose their human and morally incomplete substance, and a few "evil" souls. For a gripping story, with a dose of uncertainty and mystery, I highly recommended this work. </p>

<p>Such an engaging story. I found myself anxiously awaiting the ending and hoping that God would work things out for the main characters in the end! I love how morals, values and honesty were things to live for and strive for in this story even as people, circumstances and timing were working against them. A very true to life story that emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and God's presence in our lives. Well done.</p>

<p class="quote">
I took your book with me to read, as I was to be away from home from a couple of days.</p>
<p class="quote">Bad move!! Once I started it, I couldn't put it down - read until 3:30 AM and finished it first night!!</p>
<p class="quote">Great book - so realistic and, as a pastor for 30 years, I could relate to the chain of events and to "Clara." I am not sure there is a church without one!!! Thanks, too, for showing the Pastor as a real person with real emotions and the ability to err from time to time. It was nice not to see him on a pedestal, but also to see him as a man's man - not some effeminate tea-sipping white collared incompetent.</p>
<p class="quote">It was a great read and I appreciate the insights that are woven through the story, especially a glimpse into the life of a single-again person's feelings, etc. Please let us know when your next book is coming out.</p>

Melissa's characters face real struggles to live out their Christianity and keep their faith intact. I read til 4 A.M. because I had to see how it ended. This book is wonderful!

I have just finished your book, and pray that it gets a wide reading. It is well done, and I appreciate the message on forgiveness plus the wonderful tale. My guess would be, if I did not know it for a fact, that you have been involved in Baptist church life. I will encourage all three of my daughters to read it - wishing that my oldest could have read it, too. I like Jeff Wells, and appreciate your naming him for me.</p>

<p class="quote">What a great book!  I couldn't put it down!  I have read many books by Janette Oke and Francine Rivers and would rank Melissa Leedom's book right up there with these other great fiction writers.  I especially liked her including the plan of salvation as a very natural part of the conversation in the narrative.  I'm looking forward to the next one!</p>

<p class="quote">I finished reading your book last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am still amazed at how someone can write a book, but I am very thankful that the Lord has given folks like you such talent, as I surely do enjoy reading.  I hope that you will continue to write.

The characters are true to life in all ways. Despite their personal relationships with Christ and their respective positions in their churches, their humanity shines forth endearingly.  The romantic elements are understatedly poignant without being sickly sweet.  This book is an excellent read that truly captivates one's attention.  The only problem with it is that you won't want to put it down!  This book is available on Kindle and on Amazon.  You won't be disappointed!

Bonnie is a widow with two young boys to bring up. She is heavily involved in her church and her Pastor, Jeff is also widowed. Bonnie and Jeff realise they have a mutual liking for each other but it doesn’t take long for things to get in the way of a budding romance.</p>

<p> I enjoyed this book and found it interesting, especially as I’m married to a vicar and a lot of things in this book struck a chord with me! Overall, I liked the story and how God is shown to be so important in our every day lives. </p>

<p class="quote">This is a great book to sit and enjoy on a quiet afternoon. The story is heartwarming and the characters are lovable. The author delivers a simple message to the reader: don't let your perception cause you to judge others. If you allow the notions and preconceived ideas of other people to influence you, chances are you will be wrong. Melissa Leedom delivered a beautiful love story about forgiveness without "pushing" God to the reader. Anyone who is a non-Christian may enjoy this book because it applies to all of us. I definitely look forward to reading Melissa's other books.</p><p class="citation">Nora M.<br>Donna, TX</p>

<p>The story pulled me in early on with the strength shown in spite of heartbreak in the main character's pasts. Bonnie and Jeff are such warm, likable characters that you can't help but cheer for them to let go of their pasts and find the happiness God has in store for them. In addition to the subject of embracing new love, the author weaves into her lovely story, the strength and the steadfastness of God's love.</p><p class="citation">Faith Heart, Wilmington, NC - Amazon.com Review</p>

<p>This story is full of warm, believable characters that made me want to keep reading their story beyond this novel. The characters are realistic, human and likeable. Melissa Leedom has woven together a story that is inspirational, clean and truly heartfelt.

<p class="quote">An excellent novel on the struggle to forgive when the wounds and hurt run deep and the wounded person allows pride and resentment to get in the way. God's grace enables the wounded to forgive each other (as His grace works the same in real life) to end with a HEA!</p><p class="citation">Edwina C., <br>Newnan, GA - Amazon.com Review</p>

<p class="quote">There are some authors, like Madeleine L'Engle, that can take the essence of a concept and put it in words. This gal is one of them. It will make you cheer for the heroes and show you the correct attitude to have toward them that seek to harm you. It will have you laughing and crying, and in the end you have a better idea of what charity truly is.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book, especially to new Christians.</p>

<p class="quote">Most of us have had one of those misunderstandings in our lives. You are SURE you know the truth, only to find out you are VERY mistaken about the facts.</p>

From the main characters, Bonnie and Jeff, all the way to a young boy, JaMa'al, we find that forgiveness is needed in all aspects of life. Although, it sometimes needs a little encouragement from a special friend.</p>

It has intelligence, wit and charm woven into a plot that accurately reflects the concerns of our time.

From the first tenuous steps of a man and a woman recognizing a mutual attraction, through their journey of understanding, to the ending that could only be written with Divine guidance, the book is a page-turner.</p><p class=citation>G.S.

<p class="quote">The author has an extraordinary grasp of the dynamics in relationships and the equally masterful writing skill to capture the myriad of inner thoughts which travel back and forth between our emotions. I didn't feel like I was reading about others' lives but, actually living among the characters. I felt my anger towards Clara, my sympathy towards Anna Lee, my disgust towards Preston, my heartache towards Bonnie and Jeff, and so on.

She put me right there in the lives of good-hearted people trying to make their way as God would have them, and I can feel the romance and the hope and trepidation as if I were living the story myself.

<p class="quote">A wonderful story of love and forgiveness. Well-staged circumstances that kept me reading!</p><p class=citation>Claudette Renalds<br>Haymarket, VA - Amazon.com Review</p>

<p class="quote">There is nothing quite like old-fashioned and pure romance, especially when it happens in a book that is well written featuring likeable and charismatic characters. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> by Melissa Leedom is such a book with these qualities. Chock full of endearing characters and set in Georgia, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"></i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> is a Christian "Chick Lit" book that should not be missed.</p>

<p>Meet Bonnie, a widowed mother of two who is a dedicated Christian. She resides in Chandler City, GA, one of those small town type of places where you run into people you know every day, everywhere you go. In the beginning of our story, she has just begun to notice Jeff Wells, the pastor of Foster Road Baptist. Jeff is also widowed with a teenage son, and has just begun to notice Bonnie. The two of them however don't have time for anything but one special kiss between them before it all comes crashing down. Clara Adkinson, the town gossip, can't stand to see the two of them get together and starts spreading nasty rumors about them. And we all know how rumors can spread like wildfire in a small town! And unfortunately Clara manages to break the two of them up before anything really starts. Jeff believes Clara, and quickly cuts things off with Bonnie, who can't believe she has already fallen for him and is crushed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other things are falling apart as well - a young boy who recently joined a gang breaks into the church office; a woman who has left her cheating husband joins the church, and is suddenly spotted all around town with Jeff; Bonnie can't stop running into men she wants little or nothing to do with, including a loud-mouthed, overbearing ex-flame (that she'd never gotten together with in the first place); Clara tries to have Pastor Jeff resign from the church because of false allegations; and Bonnie and Jeff can't stop running into each other even when they try, and it's the last thing they want! Will this town and congregation ever pull together? Will this group of people ever learn to forgive each other? Find out in this heartwarming story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> was a wonderful book and I enjoyed it immensely. Bonnie, the main character, is a likeable woman with flaws that many can identify with. Her situation with Jeff as well as the other characters' lives kept me riveted to the book to see how it would all end. I also loved how the book wasn't sickly sweet and unrealistic. It showed the ins and outs of living a Christian life, even some of the bad things about it, such as hypocrisy and jealousy that sometimes takes place. Melissa Leedom manages to get the message of salvation through to her readers too in this delightful story.</p>

<p>Overall, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> to all readers who love a romantic and down-to-earth story that will tug at your heartstrings. People with a Christian background will especially like it. Do you think that a true, simple and pure love doesn't exist?

Bonnie E.<br>
McAllen, TX<br>

<p class="quote">Bonnie Callaway has had a difficult time dealing with the tragic death of her husband and, although the accident happened two years ago, she still has not given love a second chance. So, when things start happening between her and her single pastor, Jeff Wells, she isn't quite sure how to handle the transition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the attraction they were beginning to experience is shattered by distrust and betrayal. But as the compelling story of forgiveness continues, both Jeff and Bonnie are witness to lives around them being changed by forgiveness. Gradually, they are forced to recognize that, even as they urge others to love and forgive, they themselves neglect to do so.</p>

I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a> last night.  I have to say that I read it in two sittings.  It was very uplifting.  It shows that there can be life after tragedy if one is willing to open themselves up to new possibilities.  It drove home the point that we all can listen to the same message and take away something quite different.  I honestly felt sorry for Clara [the antagonist of the story] that she could not find the same kindness in her heart that Carolyn found after listening to the same message!</p>

Your characters are so well-defined - I could picture each one of them.  From Bonnie's mix of shyness and courage to Clara, whom I can see just shaking with righteous indignation.  It is said that we write what we know, and it's almost as if you know the people of Chandler City, Georgia, intimately.</p>

You've also captured the flavor of small town life, peopled with those that can be found in most every community - the good and the bad/misguided.</p>

Lastly, what a joy to read a book and know that I'm not going to run into gutter language or situations.  It isn't often that one finds that these days.

<p class="quote">I so enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a>! I was quickly pulled into the story. Some of the settings were familiar places to me, so it was fun to read about them. The story of forgiveness was a beautiful picture of God’s grace and forgiveness to us!</p><p class="citation">Rhonda Creswell<br>Vicksburg, MS</p>

It was nice meeting you at the Marble Falls conference. I wanted to let you know that I enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a>! Enjoyed the story line and the characters. Do you have any others? The picture on the book cover was a "grabber" for me! Still have not made the recipes yet--will sometime. Thanks!

I am not a "reader" due to a vision perception dysfunction. However, I have been curious about this book since I first heard about it. I was struggling with hurt and forgiveness in my own life. As I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a>, I felt like I was another character in the book. It was wonderful to be reminded of God's grace and mercy. I found it easy and delightful to read even though it has taken me a long time to do so. I typically fall asleep before the end of the page...I found myself not wanting to put it down to go to bed. Thank you, Melissa Leedom, for a wonderful Christian romance that kept me coming back day after day to complete! I highly recommend this book to everyone! <br>

<p class="quote">Hi there,</p>
<p class="quote">You don't know me, but I wanted to write you to tell you thank you. Please let me explain:</p>
<p class="quote">I was sitting home one day when my husband called me from Hastings to tell me that there was a Christian writer signing her book and asked if I would be interested in reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260GS0S?tag=tofordiv-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B00260GS0S&adid=1MTZM95FSMVM8S45J45H&"><i>To Forgive, Divine</i></a>?</p>
<p class="quote">When I told him to get it for me, I never expected a book that was as wonderful as yours. I have been reading Christian novels for a couple of years now.  There have been many I have enjoyed, but only a few that I couldn't put down. Yours was definitely one I couldn't put down.</p>
<p class="quote">Thank you for sharing your wonderful writing with the rest of us. Your book was very touching, and I am very disappointed that it's over already, so I really hope you will have another one coming out soon.</p>
<p class="quote">Good luck and God bless you.</p>
