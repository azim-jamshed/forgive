<i>I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist</i></iframe></a>
<p>To some, the concept of having faith in a higher power or a set of religious beliefs is nonsensical. Indeed, many view religion in general, and Christianity in particular, as unfounded and unreasonable. </p>

<p>Norman Geisler and Frank Turek argue, however, that Christianity is not only more reasonable than all other belief systems, but is indeed more rational than unbelief itself. With conviction and clear thinking, Geisler and Turek guide readers through some of the traditional, tested arguments for the existence of a creator God. They move into an examination of the source of morality and the reliability of the New Testament accounts concerning Jesus. The final section of the book deals with a detailed investigation of the claims of Christ. This volume will be an interesting read for those skeptical about Christianity, as well as a helpful resource for Christians seeking to articulate a more sophisticated defense of their faith.</p>

<i><b>Unplanned</i></b>   by Abby Johnson</></a>
<p>Abby Johnson quit her job in October 2009. That simple act became a national news story because Abby was the director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Texas who, after participating in an actual abortion procedure for the first time, walked down the street to join the Coalition for Life.</p>

<p>Unplanned is a heart-stopping personal drama of life-and-death encounters, a courtroom battle, and spiritual transformation that speaks hope and compassion into the political controversy that surrounds this issue. Telling Abby's story from both sides of the abortion clinic property line, this book is a must-read for anyone who cares about the life versus rights debate and helping women who face crisis pregnancies. </p></td></p>

<b><i>Bonhoeffer</i></b> by Eric Metaxas</></a>
<p>As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer&#8213;a pastor and author. In this New York Times best-selling biography, Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life&#8213;the theologian and the spy&#8213;and draws them together to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching decision to leave the safe haven of America to return to Hitler's Germany, and sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in "Operation 7," the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.</p>

<p>"Bonhoeffer is the story of a life framed by a passion for truth and a commitment to justice on behalf of those who face implacable evil."  </p></td>

<p>Quick--can you answer the following: Do your parents have a will? Who will care for them if they become ill or incapacitated? How will you and your siblings share in that responsibility?</p>

<p>Jim Comer, author of <i> When Roles Reverse: A Guide to Parenting Your Parents</i>, says that knowing the answers to questions like these can save families time, heartache and, perhaps most importantly, money they don't have to waste.</p></td>

    </iframe><b><i>Betsy Bonaparte</i></b> by Helen Jean Burn</p></a>
<p><i>Betsy Bonaparte</i> reads like a well-crafted novel--I found it nearly impossible to put down. Yet it is clearly the product of extensive and exhaustive research (painstakingly documented with copious footnotes). The historical backdrop, both American and European, against which the events of the story take place conveys the enormity of Madame Bonaparte's problems. The depth and scope of what Ms. Burn has accomplished with 200-year-old information is breathtaking.

Gleaned largely from correspondence of all the principals, Betsy Bonaparte's saga of a brief but happy marriage to one of Napoleon's younger brothers followed by years and years of struggle to survive financially, to preserve her good name and that of her son, and to gain acceptance as a woman of intellect and education, unfolds blow by heartbreaking blow. I found myself constantly in awe of how this story was literally pieced together yet proceeded seamlessly, providing great insight into the character of each person involved.

Far from being "dry history," <i>Betsy Bonaparte</i> is a moving, engrossing story that any reader with an enthusiasm for matters of the heart and home will find immensely satisfying. Buy a copy for yourself and a copy to lend to your reading friends--you won't want to risk losing your own!</p>

<p><i>Out On the Hills</i> by Peggy Lee Napier</p>  

<p>If Tom Sawyer or David Copperfield had been girls, they would probably have been Deenie O’Loughlin of Peggy Lee Napier’s Out on the Hills. A young narrator from the seclusion of West Virginia in the innocent days of the late 1940s could not be more naïve than Deenie. In an authentic Appalachian voice that stirred echoes of my paternal grandmother, Deenie tells her story with honesty and immediacy.</p>

<p>And what a story!</p>

<p>In tales of one-room schoolhouse days, bucolic meanderings through the hills and Sunday mornings of fervent worship, Deenie praising God with a stringed instrument as her sister sings, Napier’s heroine sets the stage for an adventure so harrowing it could never have been foreseen. Father is out of town and his return is repeatedly delayed. The aunt who cares for Deenie and her sister, Ilse, is called away to attend to her suddenly ill sister. The offer from a traveling preacher to feature Deenie and Ilse in his revival tour seems both providential and promising.</p>

<p>What transpires will mark the end of innocence for Deenie: what she witnesses teaches her that people are not always as they present themselves, that trust can be placed too precipitately.</p>

<p>Portraying unscrupulous people who prey on the ignorant but faithful, Napier skillfully contrasts them with Deenie and her child-like faith. She is careful not to cast into doubt the faith of the hill people because they are susceptible to the machinations of skillful con artists. Their faith is seen to be genuine because of their fervor, their charity and their love for one another. Napier even manages to work in Good Samaritans, outcasts who come to Deenie’s rescue in her most desperate hour.</p>

<p>Out On the Hills is one of those books that leaves you with a warm glow for a while after you’re done, a feel-good read that you will recommend to your friends, as I recommend it to you. Friendship and family, adventure and restoration – as satisfying a recipe for a story as any I know.</p>
