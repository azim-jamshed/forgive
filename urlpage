Enter a young boy who desperately needs help that only Bonnie and Jeff can give him,
an embittered young woman who learns about forgiveness from these two people who can't seem to forgive each other, and an estranged couple who need just a little push from reluctant lovers Bonnie and Jeff to re-write their own ill-fated love story. Bonnie and Jeff can't avoid seeing each other even when they try!</p>
<p>
As Bonnie and Jeff watch lives transformed all around them by the love and forgiveness of Jesus, they must confront their own failure to forgive. How can they recommend Christian love to everyone else and deny it to each other?</p>
