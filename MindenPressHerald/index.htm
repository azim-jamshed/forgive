write about books or do book reviews in the North Louisiana Good News, but a 
press release was recently published about a good Christian book, called "To 
Forgive, Divine," written by Melissa Leedom.<BR><BR>I won't go into all the 
details of the book and spoil it for you. It's a quick read, but the underlying 
lessons as well as the story line are absolutely wonderful.<BR><BR>The story 
begins with two people who have been going to the same church for years, one 
being the pastor of the church. He is a single widower with a teenage son, and 
she is a widow with two young children. The story line revolves around a romance 
between the two, and it revolves around the church.<BR><BR>I have to say, I was 
very impressed with the book because it was a good, clean story about two people 
who realize they love each other.<BR><BR>One of the biggest lessons I learned 
from the book was about the gossip that goes on in church. Not every church is 
like this, but many are. Gossip permeates just about every congregation to some 
extent or another. In this story, I learned just how gossip can almost ruin a 
congregation and a community � based on how things look on the 
outside.<BR><BR>Yes, the story has a villain, but this villain is a fine, 
upstanding churchgoer who is very bitter. But does she learn her lesson in the 
end? Well, you will just have to read the book to find out.<BR><BR>Another 
lesson I learned in the book is that although a pastor is always in the public 
eye of his congregation, he is human too. He has feelings just like anyone else. 
<BR><BR>It was interesting to see in this story how this pastor dealt with the 
gossip in his congregation. I was absolutely amazed at how the author made this 
pastor so human. In the book, the reader gets to see the other side of a 
pastor's life � outside the church pulpit and outside the church 
activities.<BR><BR>And, I also got to see a person in the book come to know God. 
That was really cool. And the way this woman became saved is just like so many 
others who have a life-changing experience in their salvation. The author showed 
God's strength throughout the entire book, and she showed how God changes even 
the hardest of hearts.<BR><BR>Overall, I was very impressed with the book, and 
it is the type of book I like to read. Like I said before, it's a good, clean 
story. <BR><BR>This fiction book is one that you would feel safe about your kids 
picking up, and you don't have to worry about them learning words they shouldn't 
hear or read, or even read about situations that they wouldn't understand. 
<BR><BR>Although this book is meant for an older audience, like teens and older, 
you don't have to worry about what your kids will find in it.<BR><BR>I hope that 
you will contact the author for a copy, because I think it is well worth it. If 
you wish to contact the author, just go to her web site at <A
